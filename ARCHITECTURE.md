# raise-an.ai Technical Architecture

## Overview
The system uses a modern microservices architecture with the following main components:

### Frontend Layer
- React-based SPA with TypeScript
- State management using Redux/Context
- Material UI for component library
- WebSocket integration for real-time features

### Backend Services
1. User Service
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - User profile management
   - Subscription handling

2. AI Core Service
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Prompt management
   - Tech tree progression

3. Memory Service
   - Vector database integration
   - Conversation history
   - Long-term memory management

4. Resource Service
   - Compute allocation
   - Usage tracking
   - Resource optimization

### Data Layer
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate) for embeddings
- Redis for caching
- S3-compatible storage for assets

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- AWS/GCP cloud hosting
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

## Service Communication
- REST APIs for standard requests
- gRPC for inter-service communication
- WebSocket for real-time features
- Message queue for async operations

## Security Architecture
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API Gateway for rate limiting
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

## Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling of microservices
- Database sharding for high availability
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancing across regions
