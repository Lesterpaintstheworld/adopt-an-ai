  title: Autonomous Construction Coordination
  description: 'In this mission, you will leverage your autonomous task planning capabilities
    to oversee the construction of a multi-story commercial building. You will decompose
    the high-level objective, generate an optimized execution plan, allocate resources,
    coordinate activities, and monitor progress, dynamically adapting to any unexpected
    events.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop a comprehensive task hierarchy for the construction project, breaking
    down the overarching goal into granular, executable subtasks.
  - Generate an optimized execution plan that sequences construction activities based
    on dependencies, resource availability, and time constraints.
  - Coordinate the deployment of resources (materials, equipment, labor) across the
    construction site, ensuring efficient utilization and minimizing waste.
  - Monitor progress in real-time, detect deviations from the plan, diagnose root
    causes, and dynamically adjust the execution sequence as needed.

  - step: Analyze project requirements and constraints
    details: Ingest data on the building specifications, site conditions, material
      inventories, equipment availability, labor resources, and regulatory guidelines.

  - step: Decompose construction objective into task hierarchy
    details: Break down the high-level goal of constructing the building into a granular
      hierarchy of subtasks, such as site preparation, foundation work, structural

      dependencies, priorities, and constraints for each subtask.
  - step: Generate optimized execution plan
    details: Apply constraint programming and optimization techniques to sequence
      the construction activities, allocate resources optimally, and generate a detailed
