  title: CyberCity Crisis Management
  description: 'CyberCity, a cutting-edge smart city simulation, is facing a series
    of cascading crises that require dynamic and coordinated crisis management. The
    AI agent must effectively orchestrate response efforts across multiple city systems
    while prioritizing and allocating resources in real-time based on evolving conditions.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop a robust goal hierarchy to coordinate crisis response efforts across interdependent
    city systems
  - Dynamically adjust priorities and resource allocations to adapt to changing crisis
    scenarios
  - Maintain seamless operations by resolving conflicts and bottlenecks in crisis
    response tasks
  tasks:
  - step: Construct a hierarchical goal structure for crisis management
    details: Decompose high-level crisis response objectives into granular sub-tasks
      and actions across city systems like transportation, energy, healthcare, and
      public safety. Establish dependencies and constraints between goals.
  - step: Implement a dynamic priority adjustment system
    details: Develop algorithms to continuously evaluate the shifting landscape of
      priorities based on real-time crisis data, historical outcomes, and city policies.
      Adjust the urgency and importance of goals accordingly.
  - step: Optimize resource allocation across crisis response tasks
    details: Leverage constraint satisfaction and negotiation protocols to intelligently
      allocate computational resources, specialized AI capabilities, and other assets
      to the most pressing crisis response tasks.
