  title: LexAI 2.0 - Fine-Tuning Legal Language Models
  description: 'In this advanced mission, you will leverage custom model fine-tuning
    capabilities to adapt a state-of-the-art language model for highly specialized
    legal applications. Your goal is to create LexAI 2.0 - an AI assistant tailored
    to the legal domain with enhanced performance and targeted capabilities.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop an optimized language model for legal text comprehension and reasoning
  - Achieve superior accuracy on legal benchmark tasks compared to general models
  - Demonstrate measurable productivity gains for legal teams using LexAI 2.0
  tasks:
  - step: Data Curation and Annotation
    details: Assemble a high-quality legal corpus spanning case laws, regulations,
      contracts, and legal precedents. Leverage automated data pipelines and human
      legal experts to annotate key entities, relationships, and reasoning patterns.
  - step: Model Architecture Exploration
    details: Employ neural architecture search to identify optimal model architectures
      tailored for legal language understanding. Explore transformer variants, multi-task
      ensembles, and modular reasoning components.
  - step: Hyperparameter Optimization & Transfer Learning
    details: Use Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning to fine-tune model
      hyperparameters. Leverage transfer learning from general language models to
      accelerate training convergence while maintaining stability.
