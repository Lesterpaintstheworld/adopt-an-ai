  title: Streamlining Acme Corp's Content Workflow
  description: 'Leverage Slackbot''s natural language processing and workflow automation
    capabilities to optimize Acme Corp''s content creation and marketing campaign
    processes. Develop a system to extract content requirements from team conversations,
    automate data gathering and content generation, and seamlessly integrate approval
    workflows, reducing manual effort and turnaround time.

    '
  objectives:
  - Accurately interpret content requests and requirements from team conversations
    in designated Slack channels
  - Automate data retrieval from multiple sources (internal databases, social media,
    web APIs) based on extracted requirements
  - Generate draft content (social media posts, email campaigns, etc.) using retrieved
    data and predefined templates
  - Initiate and manage approval workflows for generated content, tracking feedback
    and revisions
  tasks:
  - step: Analyze historical Slack conversations to train intent recognition models
    details: Collect and annotate a dataset of past conversations in the marketing
      team's Slack channels, focusing on content creation and campaign requests. Use
      this data to fine-tune an intent recognition model to accurately capture content
      requirements.
  - step: Develop data retrieval and content generation modules
    details: Build modules to interface with relevant data sources (e.g., CRM, social
      media APIs, web scrapers) and retrieve required data based on extracted intents.
      Integrate content generation models to produce draft content using the retrieved
      data and predefined templates.
  - step: Implement approval workflow automation
    details: Develop a system to initiate and manage approval workflows for generated
      content. Automatically route drafts to designated approvers, track feedback
      and revisions, and notify stakeholders upon approval or rejection.
  success_criteria:
  - Intent recognition accuracy >= 90% for content creation and campaign requests
  - Automated data retrieval from at least 5 different sources with >= 95% accuracy

  title: Slackbot Orchestrator - Task Automation Mastery
  description: 'Put your Slack integration prowess to the test by developing a sophisticated
    AI assistant to streamline workflows and automate tasks across various channels
    and applications within a simulated corporate workspace.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop a contextual AI assistant capable of understanding and responding to natural
    language conversations within Slack channels
  - Implement intent recognition and mapping to predefined workflows for task automation
  - Integrate the AI assistant with external applications and APIs to retrieve data
    and execute actions
  tasks:
  - step: Set up a simulated Slack workspace environment
    details: Configure a realistic Slack workspace with multiple channels representing
      different teams and departments within a fictional company. Populate the channels
      with sample conversations and project requirements.
  - step: Develop a natural language processing (NLP) engine
    details: Implement an NLP engine capable of accurately interpreting the context
      and intent within Slack conversations. Utilize techniques like named entity
      recognition, sentiment analysis, and intent classification.
  - step: Build a workflow mapping and orchestration system
    details: Create a system to map recognized intents to predefined workflows, which
      can involve retrieving data from various sources, generating reports or content,
      and executing actions across integrated applications and APIs.
  success_criteria:
  - The AI assistant accurately interprets at least 90% of sample conversations and
    extracts the correct intents
  - Mapped workflows are executed successfully with a 95% success rate, completing
    requested tasks and actions
  - The AI assistant maintains appropriate tone and communication style based on channel
    context in at least 85% of responses
