      and issue management workflow.
  - step: Set up your development environment and fork the project repository
    details: Follow the project's instructions to configure your local development
      environment and create a fork of the main repository.
  - step: Contribute code changes and submit pull requests
    details: Identify areas for improvement or new features to implement. Make the
      necessary code changes, ensuring adherence to the project's coding standards
      and best practices. Submit well-documented pull requests for review.
  - step: Review and provide feedback on open pull requests
    details: Use the GitHub integration to review open pull requests from other contributors.
      Provide detailed code reviews, identifying potential issues, suggesting improvements,
      and ensuring compliance with project guidelines.
  - step: Triage and categorize new issues
    details: Leverage the AI's natural language processing capabilities to understand
      and categorize new issues reported by the community. Suggest potential solutions,
      workarounds, or request additional information as needed.
  - step: Contribute to project documentation and knowledge base
    details: Identify areas where the project's documentation can be improved or expanded.
      Use the AI's documentation capabilities to generate clear and comprehensive
      documentation from code comments and specifications.
