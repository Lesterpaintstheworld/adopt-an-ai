  title: Sustainable City Redesign
  description: 'Utilize the Infinite Resource Wisdom system to redesign an existing
    major city into a fully sustainable, zero-waste, self-sufficient urban ecosystem
    that meets the current and projected needs of its residents while minimizing environmental
    impact.

    '
  objectives:
  - Design an urban infrastructure enabling 100% recycling and reuse of water, materials
    and energy
  - Develop interconnected systems that harness local renewable resources to meet
    all operational demands
  - Implement dynamic resource optimization to efficiently allocate provisions based
    on fluctuating needs
  tasks:
  - step: Conduct in-depth analysis of the city's current resource flows and usage
      patterns
    details: Collect detailed data on energy, water, food, manufacturing inputs/outputs
      and waste streams. Identify inefficiencies, losses and unsustainable practices.
  - step: Map all available local renewable energy sources and raw material reserves
    details: Use planetary/geological scans to detect potential wind, solar, geothermal,
      tidal, biomass & mineral sources within the surrounding region.
  - step: Design closed-loop infrastructure for 100% recycling and recapturing of
      water, solid/liquid waste and emissions
    details: Incorporate municipal biomolecular reconstruction facilities, atmospheric
      carbon capture, water treatment/desalination plants, etc.
  - step: Develop smart urban systems integrating Internet-of-Things sensor networks,
      AI optimization and responsive distribution
    details: Install smart grids, smart transit, automated vertical farming, 3D printed
      construction and connected appliances managed by Infinite Resource Wisdom.
  - step: Run iterative simulations to refine and validate the sustainable city design
    details: Ensure the systems are dynamically balanced with adequate buffer capacity
      for demand fluctuations and edge cases. Eliminate waste and overprovisioning.
  success_criteria:
  - City operates with zero net greenhouse emissions, waste output and nonrenewable
    resource usage
