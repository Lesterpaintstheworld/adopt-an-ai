  title: Empathetic AI Companion
  description: 'Develop an AI companion capable of detecting and responding appropriately

    to human emotions. The AI should engage in natural conversations, recognizing

    emotional cues from text, speech, and facial expressions to provide empathetic

    and emotionally resonant responses.

    '
  objectives:
  - Implement emotion detection from multimodal inputs (text, audio, visuals)
  - Generate contextually appropriate emotional responses
  - Maintain consistent emotional expression patterns across interactions
  tasks:
  - step: Integrate emotion detection models
    details: Incorporate state-of-the-art models to detect emotions from text inputs
      (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa), speech patterns (e.g. audio feature extraction), and facial
      expressions (e.g. convolutional neural networks).
  - step: Develop emotional response generation
    details: Implement conditional language models to generate emotionally appropriate
      text responses based on detected emotions and conversational context. Leverage
      techniques like persona modeling and trait-based response variation.
  - step: Build interactive interface
    details: Create a multimodal interface with text, audio, and video input/output
      to facilitate natural conversational interactions with the AI companion.
  success_criteria:
  - Emotion detection accuracy ≥ 80% across modalities
  - Coherent, context-appropriate emotional responses ≥ 75% of interactions
  - Consistent emotional tone maintained over 90% of multi-turn dialogues
  evaluation_metrics:
  - metric: Emotion classification F1 score
    target: ≥ 0.85

  title: Personalized Customer Support AI
  description: 'Design and develop an AI customer support assistant that can recognize
    and respond to customers'' emotional states, providing personalized and empathetic
    service tailored to each user''s emotional context.

    '
  objectives:
  - Create an AI system capable of accurately detecting basic emotions from customer
    text inputs and vocal patterns
  - Generate emotionally appropriate responses that match the customer's emotional
    state and maintain a natural conversational flow
  - Integrate emotional intelligence into a customer support workflow to improve customer
    satisfaction and resolution rates
  tasks:
  - step: Collect and annotate a diverse dataset of customer service interactions
    details: Gather a large corpus of text logs, voice recordings, and other multimodal
      data from real customer support interactions. Annotate each interaction with
      labels for the customer's expressed emotions (e.g., frustration, joy, anger,
      etc.).
  - step: Train emotion detection models
    details: Using the annotated dataset, train machine learning models (e.g., transformer-based
      language models, acoustic feature analysis) to accurately classify customers'
      emotional states from text inputs and vocal patterns.
  - step: Develop an emotional response generation system
    details: Build a system that can generate emotionally appropriate responses based
      on the detected customer emotional state, interaction context, and predefined
      conversational guidelines. Incorporate techniques like personality trait modeling
      and emotional expression patterns.
  - step: Integrate the emotion modeling system into a customer support workflow
    details: Implement the emotional intelligence capabilities within a customer support
      application or chatbot, allowing the AI assistant to dynamically adapt its responses
      and communication style based on each customer's emotional state throughout
      the interaction.
  success_criteria:
  - Emotion detection accuracy of at least 80% on a held-out test set
  - Customer satisfaction scores at least 15% higher compared to a non-emotional baseline
    system
  - Resolution rates improved by at least 10% for emotionally charged customer interactions
  evaluation_metrics:
  - metric: Emotion detection F1 score
    target: '>= 0.8'
  - metric: Customer satisfaction rating increase
    target: '>=15%'
  - metric: Resolution rate increase for emotional interactions
    target: '>=10%'
