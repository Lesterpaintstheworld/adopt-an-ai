  title: Predictive Scaling Simulator
  description: 'Design and implement a predictive scaling simulator that leverages
    Dynamic Resource Scaling capabilities to optimize resource allocation for an AI-driven
    application. The simulator should accurately forecast future compute demands,
    recommend scaling actions, and evaluate the performance impact.

    '
  objectives:
  - Build a predictive model to forecast future resource demands based on historical
    data and real-time metrics
  - Develop a resource orchestration system to simulate scaling actions based on model
    recommendations
  - Evaluate the simulator's performance in maintaining consistent service levels
    while optimizing resource utilization
  tasks:
  - step: Data Collection and Preprocessing
    details: Gather historical data on application usage patterns, performance metrics,
      and external factors. Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers,
      and ensure compatibility with the predictive model.
  - step: Predictive Model Development
    details: Implement a machine learning model capable of forecasting future resource
      demands based on the preprocessed data. Consider time-series analysis techniques,
      anomaly detection, and confidence scoring for model predictions.
  - step: Resource Orchestration System
    details: Develop a system to simulate scaling actions based on the predictive
      model's recommendations. Define scaling policies, thresholds, and rules for
      provisioning and deprovisioning resources across multiple cloud providers.
  success_criteria:
  - The predictive model achieves a minimum forecast accuracy of 85% based on historical
    data
