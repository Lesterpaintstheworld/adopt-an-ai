  title: Resource Negotiator - Optimizing AI Workflow Execution
  description: 'In this mission, you will leverage resource sharing networks to dynamically
    optimize the execution of an AI workflow consisting of multiple interdependent
    tasks. Your goal is to develop a resource negotiation strategy that enables efficient
    resource allocation and load balancing across a network of AI agents, maximizing
    overall workflow throughput and minimizing execution time.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop a decentralized resource negotiation protocol for AI agents to advertise,
    discover, and trade computational resources and capabilities
  - Implement a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal resource
    allocation policy for the given AI workflow
  - Demonstrate improved workflow execution performance compared to static resource
    allocation baselines
  tasks:
  - step: Analyze the AI workflow and identify resource requirements for each task
    details: Decompose the workflow into individual tasks and quantify their computational
      resource needs (CPU, GPU, memory) and required AI capabilities (e.g. natural
      language processing, computer vision).
  - step: Design a resource advertisement and discovery mechanism
    details: Develop a distributed protocol for AI agents to advertise their available
      resources and capabilities, and discover resource offerings from other agents
      in the network.
  - step: Implement a game-theoretic negotiation algorithm
    details: Create a negotiation algorithm that enables agents to negotiate resource
      access or exchange terms, considering factors like resource costs, task priorities,
      and opportunity costs.
  - step: Train a multi-agent reinforcement learning model
    details: Use multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques to train a decentralized
      policy that dynamically allocates resources across the network, optimizing for
      overall workflow throughput and minimizing execution time.
  success_criteria:
  - Achieve at least 25% reduction in overall workflow execution time compared to
    static resource allocation baselines

  title: Robust Multi-Agent Resource Orchestration
  description: 'Design an advanced multi-agent system leveraging resource sharing
    networks (RSNs) to dynamically allocate computational resources and AI capabilities.
    Implement robust mechanisms for resource discovery, negotiation, allocation, and
    failover across a distributed network of heterogeneous AI agents.

    '

    trade resources

      advertisement
    details: Define a structured vocabulary to represent AI agents' resource profiles,
      capabilities, and constraints. Implement a distributed hash table allowing agents
      to publish and lookup resource offerings across the network.
  - step: Develop negotiation protocols and algorithms for multi-agent bargaining
    details: Explore game theory concepts like auction mechanisms, bargaining solutions,
      and coalition formation games. Implement protocols and algorithms enabling AI
      agents to negotiate terms for resource sharing and reach mutually beneficial
      agreements.
  - step: Implement load balancing and scheduling algorithms for dynamic resource
      allocation
    details: Leverage techniques like distributed optimization, reinforcement learning,
      and graph partitioning to dynamically allocate resources across the network
      based on changing workloads and priorities, while respecting constraints and
      preferences.
  - step: Design failover and redundancy mechanisms for resilience

      and self-healing capabilities to enable seamless failover and recovery in case
      of node failures or network partitions.
