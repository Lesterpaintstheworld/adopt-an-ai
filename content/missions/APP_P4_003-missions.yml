  title: Personalized AR Workspace Optimizer
  description: 'Leverage harmonic interfaces to design an augmented reality workspace
    that dynamically adapts to individual user preferences and workflows, enhancing
    productivity through seamless human-AI collaboration.

    '
  objectives:
  - Create a cognitive user modeling system to build comprehensive user profiles
  - Develop an adaptive UI framework to generate personalized AR workspace layouts
  - Integrate multi-modal input handling for natural interaction modalities
  tasks:
  - step: Profile User Behaviors
    details: Implement sensors and data pipelines to capture multi-modal user data
      streams - eye tracking, voice, physiological sensors, application traces, etc.
      Feed into a deep learning cognitive modeling system.
  - step: Build User Modeling Engine
    details: Develop AI models to construct high-dimensional user profiles representing
      mental processes, contexts, and preferences. Leverage meta-learning for continuous
      real-time adaptation.
  - step: Design Adaptive UI Framework
    details: Create an extensible UI framework capable of dynamically generating AR
      workspace layouts tailored to each user's predicted needs and preferences based
      on their profile.
  - step: Enable Multi-Modal Interactions
    details: Implement multi-modal input handling - voice commands, gaze tracking,
      gesture recognition. Map inputs to predicted intents from the user modeling
      system.
  - step: Construct Workspace Personalizer
    details: Integrate the user modeling, UI adaptation, and multi-modal systems into
      a holistic "Workspace Personalizer" that harmonizes the AR environment to each
      individual.
  success_criteria:
  - Workspace layouts instantly morph > 80% of the time to match predicted needs
