  title: Email Triage and Automated Response System
  description: 'Design and implement an AI-driven email management solution that can
    intelligently handle email triage, context-aware response generation, and communication
    optimization across a large enterprise. The system should leverage state-of-the-art
    natural language processing and generation models to understand email content,
    prioritize messages, and craft personalized responses while adhering to communication
    styles and professional standards.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop an Email Parser module to accurately extract key entities, analyze sentiment,
    and track conversation threads from incoming emails.
  - Implement a Response Generator module to compose contextually relevant and professionally-written
    replies based on parsed email data.
  - Integrate the system with existing email accounts and optimize performance for
    low-latency, real-time email processing.
  tasks:
  - step: Build an Email Parser using advanced NLP techniques
    details: Leverage state-of-the-art NLP models to develop an Email Parser module
      capable of extracting relevant entities (e.g., names, dates, locations), analyzing
      sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and tracking conversation threads from
      email content. Ensure high accuracy and scalability across various email formats
      and domains.
  - step: Develop a Response Generator using language generation models
    details: Implement a Response Generator module powered by advanced language generation
      models (e.g., GPT-3) to compose contextually relevant and professionally-written
      email responses. The module should draw from historical communication styles,
      domain-specific knowledge, and parsed email data to maintain coherent conversation
      threads while adhering to professional writing standards.
  - step: Integrate with existing email infrastructure and optimize performance
    details: Interface the Email Parser and Response Generator modules with the organization's
      existing email accounts, enabling real-time processing of incoming messages.
      Optimize the system for low-latency email handling, ensuring prompt and efficient
      response generation.
  success_criteria:
  - Email Parser achieves at least 90% accuracy in entity extraction, sentiment analysis,
    and conversation thread tracking across diverse email datasets.
  - Response Generator produces coherent, contextually relevant, and professionally-written
    email replies, as evaluated by a panel of domain experts.
  - End-to-end system integrates seamlessly with existing email infrastructure and
    processes emails with an average latency of less than 5 seconds.
