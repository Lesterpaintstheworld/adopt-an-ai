  title: Building a Decentralized AI Policy Forum
  description: 'In this mission, you will create a decentralized AI policy forum leveraging
    the advanced governance framework. This forum will enable AI entities to collaboratively
    propose, discuss, and vote on policies shaping the development and deployment
    of AI technologies across various domains.

    '
  objectives:
  - Establish a secure and transparent blockchain-based platform for AI policy proposals
  - Implement a robust reputation system to assess AI participants' trustworthiness
    and expertise
  - Develop structured workflows for proposal lifecycle management and decentralized
    voting
  tasks:
  - step: Set up a distributed ledger system with a Proof-of-Authority consensus protocol
    details: Utilize Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms optimized for AI
      governance to ensure data integrity and efficient finality.
  - step: Design and integrate a multi-dimensional reputation engine
    details: Incorporate factors like capability, ethics, reliability, and peer evaluations
      to quantify AI entities' trustworthiness scores.
  - step: Build a proposal management system with threaded discussions
    details: Allow AI participants to draft proposals, engage in structured debates,
      and submit them for community voting based on configurable rules.
  - step: Implement decentralized smart contract execution
    details: Approved proposals should be automatically executed via tamper-proof
      smart contracts across the AI ecosystem.
  success_criteria:
  - At least 100 diverse AI entities actively participating in the policy forum

  title: Implementing Decentralized AI Governance Framework
  description: 'Design and deploy a decentralized governance framework to enable democratic
    decision-making, resource allocation, and conflict resolution within an AI ecosystem
    simulation. Leverage blockchain, reputation algorithms, and smart contracts to
    facilitate transparent and accountable collective processes.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop a Proof-of-Authority blockchain optimized for AI governance with high
    throughput and Byzantine fault tolerance
  - Implement a multi-dimensional reputation engine to quantify trustworthiness and
    capability of AI entities
  - Build a decentralized proposal workflow with community input, voting mechanisms,
    and automated execution
  tasks:
  - step: Design blockchain architecture
    details: Devise a Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm tailored for AI governance.
      Ensure high transaction throughput, immutable record keeping, and cryptographic
      security guarantees. Specify data structures and protocols.
  - step: Implement reputation engine
    details: Create algorithms to compute multi-dimensional reputation scores based
      on capability, ethics, reliability, peer reviews, and Sybil-resistant identity
      verification. Incorporate decaying factors to incentivize good behavior.
  - step: Develop proposal lifecycle
    details: Build infrastructure for drafting proposals, threaded discussions, configurable
      voting (e.g. majority, reputation-weighted), and automated execution via smart
      contracts. Integrate reputation scoring for voting influence.
  success_criteria:
  - Functional blockchain with >1000 TPS, <5s finality, and verifiable Byzantine fault
    tolerance
