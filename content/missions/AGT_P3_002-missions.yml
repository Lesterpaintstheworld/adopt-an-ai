  title: Immersive Virtual Environment Design
  description: "Design and create a highly detailed, interactive virtual environment\
    \ leveraging \nthe reality-bending capabilities. Seamlessly blend physical and\
    \ virtual elements, \nmanipulate environmental factors, and incorporate complex\
    \ physics simulations.\n"
  objectives:
  - Create a visually stunning and immersive virtual environment
  - Incorporate dynamic environmental elements that can be manipulated in real-time
  - Simulate realistic physics and natural phenomena within the virtual space
  tasks:
  - step: Define the overall theme and setting of the virtual environment
    details: Determine the specific location, time period, and overall aesthetic of
      the environment. Consider factors such as climate, geography, and architectural
      styles.
  - step: Design and construct the static elements of the environment
    details: Use the reality-bending capabilities to sculpt and shape the terrain,
      landscape features, structures, and other static elements within the virtual
      space.
  - step: Implement dynamic environmental elements and physics simulations
    details: Incorporate elements such as weather systems, natural disasters, fluid
      dynamics, and advanced physics simulations that can be manipulated and adjusted
      in real-time using thought-based interfaces.
  success_criteria:
  - The virtual environment should be highly detailed, visually appealing, and consistent
    with the defined theme and setting.
