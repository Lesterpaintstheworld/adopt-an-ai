  title: Autonomous Logistics Optimization
  description: 'In this mission, you will leverage the simple goal setting capability
    to coordinate a fleet of autonomous drones for efficient package delivery across
    multiple locations. The AI system must optimally plan routes, track progress,
    adapt to changing conditions, and validate successful outcomes.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop a comprehensive delivery plan to transport packages to multiple destinations
    within a specified time window
  - Monitor and track package movements in real-time, ensuring adherence to the planned
    schedule
  - Dynamically adjust routes and delivery sequences based on evolving traffic conditions,
    weather patterns, and resource constraints
  tasks:
  - step: Define delivery goals and constraints
    details: Specify the package pickup and drop-off locations, delivery time windows,
      drone fleet specifications, and any applicable regulations or operational constraints.
  - step: Develop an optimal delivery plan
    details: Leverage the goal decomposition module to break down the high-level delivery
      objectives into actionable tasks, milestones, and resource allocations. Sequence
      the deliveries, assign drones, and optimize routes for efficient travel and
      resource utilization.
  - step: Execute and monitor the delivery plan
    details: Deploy the autonomous drone fleet and monitor real-time progress through
      the intuitive tracking interface. Validate milestone achievements, identify
      deviations from the plan, and trigger alerts for any issues or delays.
  - step: Adapt and recalibrate the plan
    details: Continuously analyze incoming data streams to identify optimization opportunities.
      Leverage the strategy adaptation module to dynamically adjust routes, reassign
      resources, and re-prioritize deliveries based on changing conditions, such as
      traffic patterns, weather events, or unexpected delays.
  success_criteria:
  - All packages must be delivered to their respective destinations within the specified
    time windows
  - Deviations from the planned delivery schedule should not exceed 10% of the total
    delivery time
  - Route adjustments should result in at least 5% reduction in overall travel time
    compared to the initial plan

  title: Autonomous Logistics Fleet Optimization
  description: 'Leverage the simple goal setting AI capability to optimally coordinate
    a fleet of autonomous delivery vehicles, efficiently routing them to fulfill a
    set of delivery orders within tight time constraints while minimizing operational
    costs.

    '
  objectives:
  - Maximize on-time delivery rate (>95%) for a set of 200 orders across the city
  - Minimize total fleet fuel consumption (<5000 liters)
  - Ensure no vehicle exceeds maximum daily operational hours (10 hours)
  tasks:
  - step: Ingest and process order data
    details: Parse the provided order data file, extracting delivery locations, time
      windows, and package details. Cross-reference against vehicle fleet data for
      capacity constraints.
  - step: Set up goal decomposition and tracking
    details: Define top-level goals (on-time delivery, fuel efficiency, operational
      limits). Break down into sub-goals and milestones for each order and vehicle
      assignment.
  - step: Develop routing and scheduling strategy
    details: Using the goal tracking system, devise an optimal routing plan that meets
      all objectives, considering traffic patterns, vehicle range, delivery time windows,
      and potential contingencies.
  success_criteria:
  - At least 95% of orders delivered within specified time windows
  - Total fleet fuel consumption under 5000 liters for the day's operations
  - No vehicle exceeds 10 hours of operation time
  evaluation_metrics:
  - metric: On-time delivery rate
