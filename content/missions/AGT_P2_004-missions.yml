  title: Distributed Resource Orchestration
  description: 'Design and implement a decentralized multi-agent system capable of
    dynamically

    negotiating and allocating compute resources across a heterogeneous cloud infrastructure.

    The system should leverage advanced techniques like game theory, reinforcement
    learning,

    and consensus protocols to optimize resource utilization and meet performance
    objectives.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop negotiation protocols for agents to exchange resource offers/bids
  - Implement decentralized mechanisms for resource discovery and allocation
  - Integrate reinforcement learning for strategic bidding and valuation models
  - Deploy the system on a distributed cloud testbed for evaluation
  tasks:
  - step: Design the multi-agent architecture and interaction protocols
    details: Define the agent roles, communication interfaces, and decentralized negotiation
      workflows. Specify data schemas for representing resource requirements, offers,
      constraints and objectives.
  - step: Implement the core negotiation engine
    details: Develop intelligent agents using game theory and optimization techniques
      to generate/evaluate resource offers adaptively based on demand, supply, and
      objectives. Integrate fault-tolerant consensus mechanisms.
  - step: Incorporate reinforcement learning capabilities
    details: Train agent policies to learn effective bidding/valuation strategies
      through interaction with simulated environments and other agents. Implement
      exploration/exploitation tradeoffs.
  - step: Build monitoring and analytics components
    details: Implement dashboards and reporting tools to visualize resource allocation,
      utilization metrics, and emergent agent behaviors across the system.
  success_criteria:
  - Negotiation protocols are formally specified and implemented correctly
  - Decentralized resource allocation converges without stalling or livelocks
  - Reinforcement learning models improve agent strategies over time
  - End-to-end system meets minimum quality of service targets

  - metric: Resource utilization rate
    target: '>= 80% on heterogeneous cluster'
  - metric: Aggregate job throughput
    target: '>= 20% improvement vs static allocation'
  - metric: Negotiation efficiency
    target: <= 5% overhead vs theoretical optimum
  difficulty: Advanced
