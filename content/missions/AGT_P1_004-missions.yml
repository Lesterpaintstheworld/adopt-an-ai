  title: Dynamic Resource Optimization Challenge
  description: 'Your task is to develop an AI system capable of dynamically scaling
    resources to handle variable workloads efficiently. You will be given a set of
    simulated tasks with fluctuating resource requirements, and your system must allocate
    and deallocate resources in real-time to meet demand while minimizing costs.

    '
  objectives:
  - Develop an intelligent resource management system that can dynamically allocate
    and deallocate computational resources based on task demands.
  - Implement advanced forecasting techniques to anticipate future resource needs
    and preemptively provision resources.
  - Optimize resource utilization and minimize costs by efficiently scaling resources
    up or down as needed.
  tasks:
  - step: Analyze the provided dataset of simulated tasks and their resource requirements
      over time.
    details: Study the patterns and characteristics of the workloads to identify potential
      bottlenecks and resource contention scenarios.
  - step: Design and implement a Resource Monitor component to track resource utilization
      across the simulated compute cluster in real-time.
    details: Incorporate machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and usage
      patterns.
  - step: Develop a Demand Forecaster component using time-series analysis, regression
      techniques, and deep learning models to predict future resource needs accurately.
    details: The Forecaster should consider historical data, current workloads, and
      any relevant external factors.
  - step: Implement a Resource Broker component to manage resource allocation and
      deallocation based on the Forecaster's predictions.
    details: Incorporate multi-dimensional priority-based fair scheduling and preemptive
      resource warming to ensure tasks always have the resources they need.

  title: Dynamic Resource Orchestration for AI Workload Optimization
  description: 'In this mission, you will develop and deploy an advanced resource
    management system capable of dynamically allocating and orchestrating computational
    resources across a distributed AI cluster. The system will leverage machine learning
    to forecast workload demands, intelligently provision resources from cloud providers,
    and optimize resource utilization through priority-based scheduling and preemptive
    resource warming.

    handle variable workloads cost-effectively.

    details: Develop a network of agents that can track resource utilization (CPU,
      memory, storage, network) across all nodes in the AI cluster in real-time. Integrate
      anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual usage patterns.
  - step: Build a demand forecasting system using machine learning
    details: Develop an ensemble of models combining time-series analysis, regression
      techniques, and deep learning to accurately predict future resource requirements
      based on historical workload patterns and real-time usage data.
  - step: Develop an intelligent resource broker
    details: Implement a resource broker that can automatically provision or release
      resources from cloud providers based on predicted demands. Integrate priority-based
      fair scheduling to ensure critical tasks have sufficient resources during peak
      loads. Enable preemptive resource warming to minimize task startup delays.
