  description: 'Leverage Athena''s infinite learning capability to develop a comprehensive
    knowledge base and predictive models for sustainable urban planning strategies,
    aimed at optimizing resource utilization, minimizing environmental impact, and
    fostering equitable community development.

    '
  objectives:
  - Integrate diverse data sources related to urban planning, including geographic,
    demographic, economic, environmental, and social factors.
  - Construct a multi-dimensional knowledge graph capturing intricate relationships
    and interconnections between urban planning elements.
  - Develop predictive models and simulations to evaluate the impact of various urban
    planning strategies on sustainability metrics.
