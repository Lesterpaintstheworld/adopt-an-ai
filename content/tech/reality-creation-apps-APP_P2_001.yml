description:
  short: Self-modifying, adaptive applications without human intervention
  long: Autonomous applications are self-running programs capable of modifying their
    own code, adapting to new requirements, and improving performance without human
    intervention. They leverage advanced AI techniques like code generation, reinforcement
    learning, and complex goal hierarchies to continuously evolve and optimize themselves
    based on real-world feedback and changing objectives. These applications can find
    novel solutions, enhance functionality, and boost efficiency autonomously, significantly
    reducing development and maintenance overhead.
