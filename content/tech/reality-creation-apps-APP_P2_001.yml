description:
  short: Self-modifying, adaptive applications without human intervention
  long: Autonomous applications are self-running programs capable of modifying their own code, adapting to new requirements, and improving performance without human intervention. They leverage advanced AI techniques like code generation, reinforcement learning, and complex goal hierarchies to continuously evolve and optimize themselves based on real-world feedback and changing objectives. These applications can find novel solutions, enhance functionality, and boost efficiency autonomously, significantly reducing development and maintenance overhead.
