risks_and_mitigations:
  ethical_risks:
  - risk: Unfair resource distribution
    mitigation: Implement transparent allocation algorithms and maintain detailed
      audit logs for resource allocation decisions. Regularly review and audit resource
      distribution patterns.
  - risk: Resource monopolization
    mitigation: Implement fair usage policies and enforce resource quotas based on
      priority and usage patterns. Implement dynamic resource reallocation to prevent
      monopolization.
  technical_risks:
  - risk: Resource exhaustion
    severity: High
    mitigation: Implement resource caps and automated scaling mechanisms to dynamically
      adjust capacity based on demand. Implement resource preemption and prioritization
      policies.
  - risk: Performance degradation
    severity: Medium
    mitigation: Continuous monitoring and automatic reallocation of resources based
      on performance metrics. Implement load balancing and prioritization mechanisms.
  - risk: System failures
    severity: High
    mitigation: Implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms for critical components.
      Regularly test and validate failover procedures. Maintain comprehensive disaster
      recovery plans.
