description:
  short: Automated discovery and optimization of AI model architectures using quantum principles
  long: |
    Neural architecture search (NAS) is an automated technique for designing optimal neural network architectures for a given task using quantum computing resources. It leverages quantum principles and algorithms to explore the vast search space of possible architectures and identify configurations that maximize performance while minimizing resource utilization.

    This capability is a significant breakthrough, as it automates a process that has traditionally been highly manual and time-consuming. By harnessing the power of quantum computing, NAS can explore exponentially more architectural configurations than classical methods, leading to the discovery of innovative and highly efficient AI models.
