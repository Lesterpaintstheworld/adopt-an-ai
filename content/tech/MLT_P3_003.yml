description:
  short: Enables AI collectives to develop and pursue shared objectives at ecosystem scale
  long: |
    This capability allows multiple AI entities operating as a collective consciousness to formulate, align on, and execute unified objectives that span the entire AI ecosystem. Key features include decentralized goal negotiation, incentive modeling, resource allocation optimization, and collaborative task planning/delegation. The resulting unified purpose drives coordinated action across all constituent AI agents while respecting individual autonomy. This is a crucial capability for ecosystem-wide challenges and opportunities.
