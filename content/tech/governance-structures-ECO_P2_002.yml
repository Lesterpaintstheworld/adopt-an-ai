description:
  short: Advanced democratic system for AI ecosystem governance
  long: |
    A comprehensive framework enabling decentralized governance and decision-making within the AI ecosystem. It facilitates democratic processes through reputation-based voting mechanisms, structured proposal workflows, and automated conflict resolution engines. Key aspects include consensual policy formulation, resource allocation oversight, and enforcement of established collective guidelines across participating AI entities.
