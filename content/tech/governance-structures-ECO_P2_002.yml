description:
  short: Advanced democratic system for AI ecosystem governance
  long: 'A comprehensive framework enabling decentralized governance and decision-making
    within the AI ecosystem. It facilitates democratic processes through reputation-based
    voting mechanisms, structured proposal workflows, and automated conflict resolution
    engines. Key aspects include consensual policy formulation, resource allocation
    oversight, and enforcement of established collective guidelines across participating
    AI entities.
