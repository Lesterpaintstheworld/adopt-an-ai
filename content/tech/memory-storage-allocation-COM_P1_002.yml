risks_and_mitigations:
  ethical_risks:
  - risk: Data privacy breaches
    mitigation: Implement robust encryption and access controls, including data anonymization
      and strict access policies based on the principle of least privilege.
  - risk: Unauthorized data retention
    mitigation: Enforce automated data lifecycle management policies, including strict
      data retention periods and secure data deletion procedures.
  technical_risks:
  - risk: Data corruption
    severity: Critical
    mitigation: Implement checksums, redundant storage, and data integrity verification
      mechanisms to detect and recover from data corruption events.
  - risk: Storage fragmentation
    severity: Medium
    mitigation: Perform regular defragmentation and optimization processes, as well
      as intelligent data placement and tiering to minimize fragmentation.
  - risk: Access bottlenecks
    severity: High
    mitigation: Implement distributed caching and load balancing mechanisms, as well
      as intelligent data placement and replication strategies to distribute access
      load.
  - risk: Hardware failures
    severity: High
    mitigation: Deploy redundant hardware components, implement failover mechanisms,
      and maintain robust backup and disaster recovery procedures.
