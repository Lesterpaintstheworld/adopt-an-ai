description:
  short: Management of multiple interdependent objectives with dynamic prioritization
    and resource allocation
  long: 'This capability enables AI agents to effectively manage complex hierarchies
    of goals, objectives, and sub-tasks. It facilitates dynamic prioritization and
    allocation of resources based on changing conditions and dependencies between
    goals. This is a critical capability for sophisticated AI systems that must juggle
    diverse, interconnected objectives while adapting to evolving environments and
    contexts. Key features include:


    - Hierarchical goal decomposition and structuring

    - Dependency mapping and conflict resolution

    - Dynamic priority adjustment based on context

    - Intelligent resource allocation algorithms

    - Continuous monitoring and replanning
