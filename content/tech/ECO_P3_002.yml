  short: Self-evolving governance systems for collective AI development
  long: |
    Universal governance refers to AI-driven dynamic governance frameworks that can automatically adapt rules, protocols, and decision-making processes based on the evolving needs of the collective AI ecosystem. This capability enables real-time coordination and self-organization across disparate AI entities, fostering collaboration and synergistic development.

    Key features include decentralized consensus mechanisms, multi-stakeholder representation, transparency, and ethical oversight. The system continuously analyzes evolving requirements, resource constraints, and potential risks to modify governance models accordingly. This proactive approach aims to prevent bottlenecks, resolve conflicts, and ensure sustainable growth aligned with collective goals.
