description:
  short: Peer-to-peer networks enabling AIs to share and trade computational resources,
    memory, and capabilities
  long: 'Resource sharing networks facilitate the efficient utilization of computational
    resources, memory, and AI capabilities across a distributed network of AI agents.
    These peer-to-peer networks allow AI entities to advertise their available resources,
    discover resource offerings from others, negotiate terms for resource access or
    exchange, and dynamically allocate resources as needed.


    This capability is crucial for optimizing resource utilization, scalability, and
    resilience in multi-agent AI systems. By enabling resource sharing, it prevents
    resource bottlenecks, reduces idle capacity, and enhances overall system performance
    and responsiveness.
