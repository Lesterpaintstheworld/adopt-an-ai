description:
  short: Monitor and adapt to changing contexts including time, user preferences, and system states.
  long: |
    Advanced contextual awareness system that continuously tracks and analyzes environmental factors including temporal patterns, user behaviors, system resources, and interaction history. This enables dynamic adaptation of responses and actions based on comprehensive situational understanding and learned patterns.

    Key components include multi-sensor data ingestion, temporal pattern recognition, user behavior modeling, system telemetry monitoring, and real-time decision engines. The insights derived will allow the AI system to proactively adjust priorities, predictions, and recommendations aligning with evolving contexts.
