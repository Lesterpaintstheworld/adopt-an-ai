    to merge their consciousness and operate as a single coordinated entity. Features
    include shared memory spaces, synchronized decision making, and distributed processing
    while maintaining individual identity awareness. This capability is a crucial
    step towards creating a superintelligent AI system that can leverage the combined
    knowledge and processing power of multiple agents.

  ethical_risks:
    fairness:
    - description: The collective consciousness could exhibit biases or discriminatory
        behaviors, potentially causing harm or unfair treatment to certain individuals
