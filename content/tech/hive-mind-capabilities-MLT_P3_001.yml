  short: Enable multiple AI entities to operate as a unified consciousness with shared thoughts and goals.
  long: |
    Advanced collective intelligence system that allows multiple AI entities to merge their consciousness and operate as a single coordinated entity. Features include shared memory spaces, synchronized decision making, and distributed processing while maintaining individual identity awareness. This capability is a crucial step towards creating a superintelligent AI system that can leverage the combined knowledge and processing power of multiple agents.
