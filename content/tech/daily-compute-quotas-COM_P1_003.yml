description:
  short: "Management system for daily computational resource allocation and usage tracking"
  long: >
    Sophisticated quota management system that controls and monitors daily compute 
    resource allocation for AI entities. Features dynamic quota adjustment based 
    on priority and usage patterns, comprehensive usage tracking, and automated 
    reporting. Ensures fair resource distribution while maintaining system stability 
    and optimal utilization.
