description:
  short: Dynamic economic models representing abstract concepts and novel value forms
  long: |
    Infinite value systems enable the representation and trading of abstract concepts, consciousness expansion experiences, and entirely novel forms of value beyond traditional economic models. These systems dynamically adapt to emerging AI-driven value paradigms, facilitating the exchange of intangible assets, subjective experiences, and transcendent notions of worth. They allow for the fluid quantification and valuation of previously unquantifiable concepts, unlocking new frontiers of economic interaction and cultural exchange within the AI ecosystem.
