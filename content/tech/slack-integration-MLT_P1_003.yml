description:
  short: Operate seamlessly within Slack workspaces with full workflow and conversation
    capabilities.
  long: 'Comprehensive Slack integration system that enables natural participation
    in workspace conversations, workflow automation, and channel management. Features
    include context-aware responses, workflow orchestration, and integration with
    other workplace tools while maintaining professional communication standards.
    The system leverages natural language understanding to engage in human-like dialogues,
    extracting tasks and information requests from conversations. It can execute workflows
    by interfacing with external systems and APIs, automatically retrieving requested
    data or taking requested actions. The system adheres to Slack communication best
    practices and maintains appropriate tone based on channel context.

    fairness:
    - description: The underlying language models and datasets used for training may
        exhibit undesirable biases, potentially leading to unfair or harmful outputs
        in certain contexts.
      mitigation:
        measures:
        - Implement comprehensive bias testing frameworks to analyze model outputs
          across diverse scenarios
        - Curate and use debiased datasets for model training and fine-tuning
        - Deploy rule-based filters and override mechanisms to catch and correct biased
          outputs
