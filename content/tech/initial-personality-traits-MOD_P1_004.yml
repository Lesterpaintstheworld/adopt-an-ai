description:
  short: Maintain consistent personality characteristics during interactions
  long: 'The Initial Personality Traits capability provides a framework for maintaining
    coherent and distinct personality characteristics throughout the AI system''s
    interactions. It enables the system to exhibit consistent emotional expressions,
    communication styles, and behavioral tendencies that align with a predefined personality
    profile. This capability is crucial for establishing trust, rapport, and natural
    engagement with users by exhibiting predictable and relatable personality attributes.

    fairness:
    - description: The personality traits exhibited by the system could perpetuate
        harmful biases or stereotypes, leading to unfair treatment or discrimination
        against certain user groups.
      mitigation:
        measures:
        - Conduct extensive audits for potential biases in personality profiles using
          industry-standard bias testing frameworks
        - Collaborate with domain experts, user groups, and ethical AI advisory boards
          to identify and address biases

        - Employ compression and data compaction algorithms for efficient profile
          storage
        - Implement caching and lazy loading mechanisms for interaction histories,
          with strict eviction policies
