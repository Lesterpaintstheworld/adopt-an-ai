  short: Seamless integration of biological and digital computing systems
  long: 'Bio-digital hybrid computing enables the seamless integration and interoperability
    of biological computing systems with traditional digital computing architectures.
    This groundbreaking capability combines the unique advantages of biological information
    processing with the speed and scalability of digital systems, enabling unprecedented
    levels  of computational power and efficiency.

    The core of this capability involves developing interfaces and translational layers
    that bridge the gap between  biological and silicon-based computing paradigms.
    It leverages recent breakthroughs in fields like molecular  computing, neural
    networks, and quantum biological systems to create hybrid architectures that can
    process and  exchange information between biological and digital domains.
