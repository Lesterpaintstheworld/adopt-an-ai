description:
  short: Ability to autonomously break down objectives into executable plans
  long: |
    Autonomous task planning enables AI agents to independently analyze complex objectives and dynamically create detailed execution plans. This involves breaking down high-level goals into manageable subtasks, sequencing activities based on dependencies and priorities, allocating resources optimally, and generating step-by-step instructions for execution.
    The capability aims to reduce human involvement in routine planning activities and streamline operational workflows for AI systems.
