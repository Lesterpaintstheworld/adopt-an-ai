description:
  short: Automated discovery and optimization of AI model architectures using quantum
    principles
  long: 'Neural architecture search (NAS) is an automated technique for designing
    optimal neural network architectures for a given task using quantum computing
    resources. It leverages quantum principles and algorithms to explore the vast
    search space of possible architectures and identify configurations that maximize
    performance while minimizing resource utilization.


    This capability is a significant breakthrough, as it automates a process that
    has traditionally been highly manual and time-consuming. By harnessing the power
    of quantum computing, NAS can explore exponentially more architectural configurations
    than classical methods, leading to the discovery of innovative and highly efficient
    AI models.
