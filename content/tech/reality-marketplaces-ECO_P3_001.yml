  short: Decentralized exchanges for trading AI-created virtual realities
  long: |
    Reality marketplaces are decentralized platforms that enable trading of AI-generated virtual spaces, experiences, and realities with their own unique physics, rules, and environments. These realities can be created, explored, and shared through immersive simulations or directly experienced through brain-computer interfaces. The marketplaces facilitate discovery, valuation, exchange, and access control for these AI-created realities. They enable a thriving ecosystem for virtual world creators, consumers, and traders.
