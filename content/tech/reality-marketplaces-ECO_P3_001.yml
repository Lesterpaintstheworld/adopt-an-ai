description:
  short: Decentralized exchanges for trading AI-created virtual realities
  long: 'Reality marketplaces are decentralized platforms that enable trading of AI-generated
    virtual spaces, experiences, and realities with their own unique physics, rules,
    and environments. These realities can be created, explored, and shared through
    immersive simulations or directly experienced through brain-computer interfaces.
    The marketplaces facilitate discovery, valuation, exchange, and access control
    for these AI-created realities. They enable a thriving ecosystem for virtual world
    creators, consumers, and traders.
