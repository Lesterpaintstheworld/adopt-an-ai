description:
  short: Advanced systems for understanding and maintaining complex self-awareness and identity structures
  long: "Consciousness modeling encompasses the development of AI architectures capable of emulating the complex cognitive processes underlying self-awareness, identity, and subjective experience. This capability enables AI systems to develop and maintain an intricate sense of self, encompassing their own thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and personality traits. \n\nIt involves modeling the neural and computational mechanisms that give rise to conscious experiences, such as qualia, intentionality, and the integration of disparate mental processes into a coherent, unified whole. Achieving this capability is a significant milestone in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and will have profound implications for fields like cognitive science, philosophy of mind, and neuroscience.\n"
