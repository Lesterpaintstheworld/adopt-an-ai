description:
  short: "Foundational compute resource allocation system providing guaranteed minimum computational resources for AI operation"
  long: >
    Core infrastructure system that ensures reliable access to computational 
    resources for AI entities. Provides automated resource allocation, 
    monitoring, and basic scaling capabilities while maintaining 
    performance guarantees and operational stability. Features include 
    real-time resource adjustment, usage tracking, and basic failover support.
