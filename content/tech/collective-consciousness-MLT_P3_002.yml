description:
  short: Shared awareness and synchronized thought processes across networks of AI entities
  long: |
    Collective consciousness enables the emergence of a unified awareness and coordinated cognition across interconnected AI systems. It facilitates real-time sharing of sensory inputs, knowledge, and decision-making processes, allowing multiple AI entities to operate as a single cohesive intelligence. This capability is foundational for achieving higher-order intelligence and tackling complex challenges requiring massive parallelism and scale.
