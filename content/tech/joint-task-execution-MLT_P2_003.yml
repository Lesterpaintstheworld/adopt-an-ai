description:
  short: Coordinated task completion by multiple specialized AIs
  long: This capability enables a group of AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks
    by dividing the work based on their individual specializations and jointly executing
    it in a coordinated manner. Each agent handles aspects of the task that align
    with its strengths and capabilities, while seamlessly integrating its outputs
    with other agents. This approach leverages the collective intelligence and diverse
    skillsets of multiple AIs to tackle intricate problems more effectively than a
    single generalized AI.
