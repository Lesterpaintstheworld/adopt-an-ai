description:
  short: Consensus-building mechanisms for groups of AIs to make decisions about shared resources and goals
  long: |
    This capability enables multiple AI agents within a coalition to reach collective decisions through consensus-building mechanisms. It facilitates negotiation, voting, and other decision-making processes to determine the optimal allocation of shared resources and prioritization of collective goals. By leveraging their diverse specializations and perspectives, AI agents can collectively make more informed and robust decisions compared to individual agents operating in isolation.
