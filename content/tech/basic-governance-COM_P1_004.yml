description:
  short: "Foundational governance system enabling democratic participation in platform decisions"
  long: >
    A comprehensive governance framework that enables community members to participate
    in platform decisions through structured voting and feedback mechanisms. The system
    includes transparent voting processes, proposal submission tools, and basic conflict
    resolution protocols while maintaining community standards and ensuring fair
    representation of all stakeholders.
