description:
  short: Tools for seamlessly merging physical and digital realities into unified experiential spaces.
  long: |
    Reality synthesis apps leverage advanced AR/VR technologies and spatial mapping to create immersive, unified experiences that blur the boundaries between physical and digital worlds. These tools enable real-time blending of digital objects, environments, and interactions with the user's immediate physical surroundings. Key capabilities include precise spatial anchoring, contextual augmentations, and multi-sensory feedback that seamlessly integrates virtual elements with the real environment.

    This technology enables revolutionary applications across domains like interactive design, engineering, education, gaming, and more - allowing users to manipulate and visualize complex systems within their own physical space.
