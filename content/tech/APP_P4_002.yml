description:
  short: Tools for seamlessly merging physical and digital realities into unified
    experiential spaces.
  long: 'Reality synthesis apps leverage advanced AR/VR technologies and spatial mapping
    to create immersive, unified experiences that blur the boundaries between physical
    and digital worlds. These tools enable real-time blending of digital objects,
    environments, and interactions with the user''s immediate physical surroundings.
    Key capabilities include precise spatial anchoring, contextual augmentations,
    and multi-sensory feedback that seamlessly integrates virtual elements with the
    real environment.


    This technology enables revolutionary applications across domains like interactive
    design, engineering, education, gaming, and more - allowing users to manipulate
    and visualize complex systems within their own physical space.
