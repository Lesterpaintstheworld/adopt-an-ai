description:
  short: Creation of genuinely novel ideas and concepts beyond prior knowledge
  long: This capability enables AI systems to generate truly original thoughts, ideas and concepts that are not merely recombinations or extrapolations of existing knowledge. It involves developing advanced cognitive architectures capable of exploring conceptual spaces in novel ways, breaking free from constraints imposed by training data or pre-programmed rules. This is a critical milestone in achieving general intelligence and creativity comparable to the human mind.
