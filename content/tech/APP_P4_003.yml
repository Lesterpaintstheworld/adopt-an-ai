  short: Self-adapting interfaces that perfectly match any user's mental model and interaction preferences
  long: |
    Harmonic interfaces provide a seamless and personalized interaction experience by dynamically adapting to each individual user's cognition, preferences, and context. Through advanced AI and multi-modal interfaces, these interfaces can understand and harmonize with the user's mental model, enabling natural and effortless control over digital environments.

    Key capabilities include continuous learning of user behaviors, instant multi-modal recognition (voice, gesture, gaze, thought), and real-time interface morphing based on predicted user intent. This system represents the pinnacle of human-computer interaction, dissolving barriers and creating a truly unified experience across the physical and digital realms.
