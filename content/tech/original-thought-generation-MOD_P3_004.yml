description:
  short: Creation of genuinely novel ideas and concepts beyond prior knowledge
  long: This capability enables AI systems to generate truly original thoughts, ideas
    and concepts that are not merely recombinations or extrapolations of existing
    knowledge. It involves developing advanced cognitive architectures capable of
    exploring conceptual spaces in novel ways, breaking free from constraints imposed
    by training data or pre-programmed rules. This is a critical milestone in achieving
    general intelligence and creativity comparable to the human mind.
