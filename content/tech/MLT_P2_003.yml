description:
  short: Coordinated task completion by multiple specialized AIs
  long: This capability enables a group of AI agents to collaborate on complex tasks by dividing the work based on their individual specializations and jointly executing it in a coordinated manner. Each agent handles aspects of the task that align with its strengths and capabilities, while seamlessly integrating its outputs with other agents. This approach leverages the collective intelligence and diverse skillsets of multiple AIs to tackle intricate problems more effectively than a single generalized AI.
