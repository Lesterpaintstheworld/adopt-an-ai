description:
  short: Dynamically request and allocate additional computational resources based
    on task requirements.
  long: 'Intelligent resource management system that monitors task demands and automatically
    requests additional compute power, memory, or storage as needed. The system includes
    usage forecasting, priority-based allocation, and efficient resource release protocols
    to optimize overall system performance.


    By dynamically scaling resources, the system ensures tasks have sufficient compute
    power during peak loads while releasing unused resources during low demand periods.
    This improves overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
