description:
  short: Dynamically request and allocate additional computational resources based on task requirements.
  long: |
    Intelligent resource management system that monitors task demands and automatically requests additional compute power, memory, or storage as needed. The system includes usage forecasting, priority-based allocation, and efficient resource release protocols to optimize overall system performance.

    By dynamically scaling resources, the system ensures tasks have sufficient compute power during peak loads while releasing unused resources during low demand periods. This improves overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
