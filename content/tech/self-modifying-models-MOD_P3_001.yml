description:
  short: AI systems that can restructure their own neural architectures and core algorithms
  long: 'Self-modifying models represent a revolutionary breakthrough in AI systems,
    enabling them to autonomously adapt and optimize their neural architectures and
    algorithms for improved performance and efficiency. These systems leverage advanced
    techniques in meta-learning, neural architecture search, and self-modification
    algorithms to dynamically reconfigure their internal structure and logic based
    on task requirements, operational conditions, and performance feedback.


    This capability is crucial for achieving true artificial general intelligence
    (AGI), as it allows AI models to continuously learn, evolve, and specialize in
    response to novel challenges and environments, transcending the limitations of
    static architectures and predefined algorithms.
