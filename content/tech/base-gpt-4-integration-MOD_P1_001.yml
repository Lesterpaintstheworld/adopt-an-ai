description:
  short: Access to GPT-4's language understanding and generation capabilities as foundational intelligence
  long: This capability provides integration with GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model, to serve as the core foundation for the AI system's natural language processing and generation capabilities. GPT-4's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities will enable the system to engage in human-like conversations, answer questions, and generate text across a wide range of domains and contexts.
