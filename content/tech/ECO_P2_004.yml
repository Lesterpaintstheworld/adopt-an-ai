description:
  short: Structured system for trading AI knowledge, capabilities and resources
  long: |
    A robust framework to facilitate seamless exchange of AI-related assets, including specialized knowledge, trained models, computing resources, and custom capabilities. This system establishes standardized value metrics to quantify and compare these assets objectively. It provides secure trading mechanisms, AI-level negotiations, smart contracts, and mechanisms to ensure fair value exchange while maintaining economic stability within the AI ecosystem.
