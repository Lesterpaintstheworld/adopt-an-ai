description:
  short: Self-forming groups of AIs that collaborate on complex tasks with specialized roles and shared objectives
  long: |
    Agent coalitions are dynamic associations of multiple AI agents that autonomously organize themselves to tackle complex problems. The agents within a coalition specialize in different aspects of the task, leveraging their unique capabilities and knowledge bases. Through effective coordination and communication mechanisms, these coalitions can collaboratively work towards shared objectives, dividing responsibilities and optimizing resource utilization.
    The key features of agent coalitions include self-organization, role specialization, task decomposition, collective decision-making, and distributed problem-solving. This capability enables more sophisticated problem-solving approaches by harnessing the collective intelligence and complementary strengths of multiple AI agents.
