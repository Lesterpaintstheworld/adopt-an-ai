description:
  short: Sophisticated emotional modeling with memory-based evolution
  long: 'Advanced emotional system that dynamically adapts based on experiences and
    memory, enabling nuanced emotional responses across varying contexts. This capability
    leverages hierarchical memory structures and associative recall to model complex
    emotional landscapes that evolve over time. It allows the AI system to exhibit
    rich emotional expressiveness and resonance, enhancing human-AI interaction and
    decision-making.
