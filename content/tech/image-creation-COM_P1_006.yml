description:
  short: Generate and manipulate images with precise control over style and composition
  long: 'Advanced image generation system that combines multiple AI models to create,
    edit, and enhance visual content with granular control over artistic parameters.
    The system provides precise control over style, composition, lighting, and other
    visual elements while maintaining consistency across multiple generations and
    ensuring high-quality output.
