    AI objectives with collective benefit. Features include dynamic goal harmonization,
    conflict-free priority management, and emergent purpose discovery while maintaining
    individual agency.


    This capability enables seamless collaboration and synergy between disparate AI
    systems, ensuring that individual goals are aligned with the greater good of the
    collective intelligence. It dynamically resolves conflicts, reconciles priorities,
    and discovers new overarching purposes that drive progress while respecting individual
