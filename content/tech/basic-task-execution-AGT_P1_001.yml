risks_and_mitigations:
  ethical_risks:
    fairness:
    - description: Prioritization algorithms could inadvertently introduce bias by
        favoring certain task types, user groups, or organizations, leading to unfair
        allocation of resources and potential discrimination.
      mitigation:
        measures:
        - Formalize priority criteria based on consensus ethical principles and stakeholder
          input
        - Implement strict monitoring and review processes for prioritization decisions
        - Enable detailed forensic audits of prioritization factors and outcomes
        - Establish a governance body to oversee prioritization policies and address
          concerns
        strategy: Apply ethical guidelines and oversight in policy definition, enable
          auditing of decision factors, and establish governance processes to address
          potential biases.
      risk: Task Prioritization Bias
      severity: High
  operational_risks:
    stability:
    - description: Inconsistencies between task definition formats could arise over
        time due to changes in requirements, schema updates, or integration with external
        systems, leading to parsing errors, execution failures, and data corruption.
      mitigation:
        measures:
        - Define and enforce rigorous task schema standards with version control
        - Implement schema validation and compatibility checks prior to execution
        - Maintain comprehensive regression test suites for schema changes
        - Enable automatic schema compatibility checks and migration tools
        - Implement strict change management processes for schema updates
        strategy: Establish strict schema governance, semantic validation, automated
          testing processes, and change control mechanisms to ensure consistent task
          definitions.
      risk: Task Definition Drift
      severity: High
  technical_risks:
    resource_management:
    - description: Concurrent tasks may exceed allocated resource capacity due to
        workload spikes, misconfiguration, or inefficient resource utilization, leading
        to system bottlenecks, timeouts, task failures, and potential data loss or
        corruption.
      mitigation:
        measures:
        - Task prioritization based on criticality, deadlines, and resource requirements
        - Resource pre-allocation, sandboxing, and isolation mechanisms
        - Preemptive task termination or throttling for priority workloads
        - Automatic scaling of execution nodes based on demand
        monitoring:
          alerts:
          - Utilization exceeds defined thresholds for CPU, memory, and I/O
          - Queue length violations and task queueing delays
          metrics:
          - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O) across execution nodes
          - Task queueing delays and queue lengths
          - Task throughput and error rates
        strategy: Implement intelligent scheduling, prioritization, resource isolation,
          and auto-scaling mechanisms, coupled with comprehensive monitoring and alerting
          capabilities.
      probability: High
