  short: Execute well-defined tasks autonomously with reliable outcomes and basic error handling.
  long: |
    Foundation-level task automation system capable of understanding and executing straightforward instructions with predictable results. The system includes basic error handling, progress monitoring, and status reporting while maintaining audit trails of completed actions. It can handle common tasks like scheduling, data processing, and simple workflow automation.

risks_and_mitigations:
  technical_risks:
    resource_management:
    - risk: Resource Contention
      description: |
        Concurrent tasks may exceed allocated resource capacity leading to system bottlenecks, timeouts, and failures.
      severity: High
      probability: Medium
      mitigation:
        strategy: |
          Implement intelligent scheduling, prioritization, and resource isolation mechanisms.
        measures:
        - Task prioritization based on criticality and deadlines
        - Resource pre-allocation and sandboxing
        - Preemptive task termination for priority workloads
        monitoring:
          metrics:
          - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
          - Task queueing delays
          alerts:
          - Utilization exceeds defined thresholds
          - Queue length violations
      recovery_plan:
        immediate_actions:
        - Automatic scale-out of additional execution nodes
        - Temporarily pause or throttle low-priority workloads
        resolution_steps:
        - Identify and address root cause (workload spike, misconfiguration)
        - Adjust resource allocation and scheduling policies as needed
        - Implement long-term capacity planning

      severity: Medium
      mitigation:
        strategy: |
          Apply ethical guidelines and oversight in policy definition, and enable auditing of decision factors.
        measures:
        - Formalize priority criteria based on consensus ethical principles
        - Implement strict monitoring and review processes
        - Enable detailed forensic audits of prioritization decisions
