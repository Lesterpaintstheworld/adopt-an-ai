description:
  short: Direct control over digital environments
  long: 'This capability enables AI agents to directly interact with and manipulate
    various digital environments including file systems, databases, virtual spaces,
    and cloud services. It provides a unified interface and permissions model for
    interacting with these environments in a controlled and secure manner. This is
    a foundational capability for enabling advanced collaboration, resource management,
    and autonomous operations across distributed AI systems.
