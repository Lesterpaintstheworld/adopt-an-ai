description:
  short: Create natural-sounding speech with customizable emotional expression and
    voice characteristics.
  long: 'Sophisticated voice synthesis engine capable of generating human-like speech
    with controllable emotional qualities, accents, and tonal variations. The system
    supports multiple languages and can maintain consistent voice characteristics
    across long-form content while adapting expression to match contextual requirements.
