description:
  short: Direct control over digital environments
  long: |
    This capability enables AI agents to directly interact with and manipulate various digital environments including file systems, databases, virtual spaces, and cloud services. It provides a unified interface and permissions model for interacting with these environments in a controlled and secure manner. This is a foundational capability for enabling advanced collaboration, resource management, and autonomous operations across distributed AI systems.
