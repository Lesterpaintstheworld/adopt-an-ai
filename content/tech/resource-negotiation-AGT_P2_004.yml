description:
  short: Sophisticated protocols for negotiating compute time, memory, and other resources
    with other AIs
  long: 'This capability enables autonomous agents to dynamically negotiate resource
    allocation with other agents in a distributed system. It leverages advanced game-theoretic
    models, multi-agent optimization techniques, and decentralized consensus protocols
    to ensure fair and efficient distribution of compute resources. The capability
    is crucial for enabling complex multi-agent collaboration and avoiding resource
    contention in large-scale AI deployments.
