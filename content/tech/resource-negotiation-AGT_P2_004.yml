description:
  short: Sophisticated protocols for negotiating compute time, memory, and other resources with other AIs
  long: |
    This capability enables autonomous agents to dynamically negotiate resource allocation with other agents in a distributed system. It leverages advanced game-theoretic models, multi-agent optimization techniques, and decentralized consensus protocols to ensure fair and efficient distribution of compute resources. The capability is crucial for enabling complex multi-agent collaboration and avoiding resource contention in large-scale AI deployments.
