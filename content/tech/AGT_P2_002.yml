  short: Management of multiple interdependent objectives with dynamic prioritization and resource allocation
  long: |
    This capability enables AI agents to effectively manage complex hierarchies of goals, objectives, and sub-tasks. It facilitates dynamic prioritization and allocation of resources based on changing conditions and dependencies between goals.

    - Hierarchical goal decomposition and structuring
    - Dependency mapping and conflict resolution
    - Dynamic priority adjustment based on context
    - Intelligent resource allocation algorithms
    - Continuous monitoring and replanning
