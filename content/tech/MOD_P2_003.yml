description:
  short: Sophisticated emotional modeling with memory-based evolution
  long: |
    Advanced emotional system that dynamically adapts based on experiences and memory, enabling nuanced emotional responses across varying contexts. This capability leverages hierarchical memory structures and associative recall to model complex emotional landscapes that evolve over time. It allows the AI system to exhibit rich emotional expressiveness and resonance, enhancing human-AI interaction and decision-making.
