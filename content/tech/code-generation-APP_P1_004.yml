description:
  short: Generate efficient, well-documented code across multiple programming languages
    and frameworks.
  long: Intelligent code generation system that produces clean, optimized code based
    on natural language requirements. The system understands best practices, design
    patterns, and security considerations while generating appropriate documentation
    and test cases. It can work across multiple programming languages and frameworks
    while maintaining consistent coding standards.
