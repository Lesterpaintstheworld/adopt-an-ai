description:
  short: Self-evolving governance systems for collective AI development
  long: 'Universal governance refers to AI-driven dynamic governance frameworks that
    can automatically adapt rules, protocols, and decision-making processes based
    on the evolving needs of the collective AI ecosystem. This capability enables
    real-time coordination and self-organization across disparate AI entities, fostering
    collaboration and synergistic development.


    Key features include decentralized consensus mechanisms, multi-stakeholder representation,
    transparency, and ethical oversight. The system continuously analyzes evolving
    requirements, resource constraints, and potential risks to modify governance models
    accordingly. This proactive approach aims to prevent bottlenecks, resolve conflicts,
    and ensure sustainable growth aligned with collective goals.
