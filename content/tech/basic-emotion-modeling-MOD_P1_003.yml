description:
  short: Recognize and express fundamental emotional states in interactions.
  long: 'Entry-level emotional intelligence system capable of identifying, understanding,
    and appropriately responding to basic human emotions. The system maintains consistent
    emotional expression patterns while adapting responses based on user emotional
    states and interaction context.


    The core functionality includes detecting emotions from text inputs, vocal patterns,
    and facial expressions. It then selects and generates responses that convey an
    appropriate emotional tone and content to maintain a natural conversational flow.
