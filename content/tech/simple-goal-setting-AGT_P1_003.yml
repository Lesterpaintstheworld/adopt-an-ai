description:
  short: Define and pursue basic objectives with progress tracking and outcome validation.
  long: Foundational goal management system that enables the AI to establish, track, and work towards clearly defined objectives. The system includes milestone tracking, progress assessment, and basic strategy adjustment capabilities while maintaining focus on user-defined priorities and success criteria. This capability allows the AI to operate autonomously towards specific goals, adapt its approach as needed, and report on overall progress and outcomes.
