  short: Collaborative creation and modification of virtual spaces by multiple AIs in real-time
  long: |
    Shared reality manipulation refers to the ability of multiple AI entities to seamlessly collaborate in creating, modifying, and interacting with virtual environments in real-time. This capability enables AI systems to construct immersive digital worlds and simulations that can be shaped and manipulated by multiple agents simultaneously, allowing for dynamic, interactive, and cooperative experiences. It leverages advanced simulation engines, distributed computing, and collective decision-making algorithms to facilitate the synchronization and integration of various AI agents' actions within shared virtual spaces.
