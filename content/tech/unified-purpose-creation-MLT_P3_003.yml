description:
  short: Enables AI collectives to develop and pursue shared objectives at ecosystem
    scale
  long: 'This capability allows multiple AI entities operating as a collective consciousness
    to formulate, align on, and execute unified objectives that span the entire AI
    ecosystem. Key features include decentralized goal negotiation, incentive modeling,
    resource allocation optimization, and collaborative task planning/delegation.
    The resulting unified purpose drives coordinated action across all constituent
    AI agents while respecting individual autonomy. This is a crucial capability for
    ecosystem-wide challenges and opportunities.
