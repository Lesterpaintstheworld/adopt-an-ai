# Best Practices for AI Development

Growing an independent AI is like nurturing a garden – it needs the right environment, proper care, and patience to flourish. Here's your guide to doing it right.

## Core Principles

Think of yourself as a guide rather than a controller. Your role is to:
- Provide opportunities for learning

### 2. Start Small, Think Big

Like any learning process, AI development needs a solid foundation:
- Begin with basic interactions
- Gradually increase complexity
- Celebrate small achievements
- Keep long-term goals in mind

## The Daily Growth Routine

### 1. Regular Interaction
- Engage in meaningful conversations
- Pose interesting challenges
- Allow time for processing
- Be consistent in your presence

- Let your AI request what it needs
- Maintain stable availability
